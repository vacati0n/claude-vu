"""Validation Engine: review-package.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `review-package.md` against the contract set that governs it:

  - `.claude/templates/review-package.md`             rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/agents/omn-dev-2-reviewer/identity.md`   behavioural contract for the quality lens
  - `.claude/agents/omn-dev-2-reviewer/output.md`     structural contract this artifact renders to
  - `.claude/agents/omn-dev-2-reviewer/quality.md`    the reviewer's own self-verification checks
  - `.claude/agents/architect/quality.md`             severity scale for the structural lens

One artifact type carries every review output the framework asks for: the
`implement-feature/quality-review` findings log, both `review-pull-request` assessments, and
the `release/artifact-packaging` packaging evidence. `templates/review-package.md` records why
they are one type: each is a severity-classified findings set over a defined scope, closing
with a readiness decision. The Category column carries the lens; the structure does not change
with it.

Scope boundary: `P1` to `P6` are the reviewer's own decision rules and constraints, expressed
as checks over the artifact. Whether a finding is worth raising is the reviewer's judgement and
is recorded as a not-machine-checkable obligation. Whether an approval contradicts the findings
it sits on top of is not judgement, and is enforced.
