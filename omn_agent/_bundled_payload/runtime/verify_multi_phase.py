"""Executable validation for multi-phase orchestration.

`verify_vertical_slice.py` proves that one phase really executed. This script proves the
claim this slice makes instead: that a run is a **state machine over many phases**, that
its transitions are legal and ordered, that gates hold successors, and that re-running the
same request does not duplicate any side effect.

Nothing here is asserted from a specification document. Every check reads live run state:
`state.json`, `events.jsonl`, the per-phase ledgers, and the artifacts themselves. The
final check is not a read at all -- it re-executes the runtime against the same request and
proves that nothing changed.

Usage:
    python .claude/runtime/verify_multi_phase.py [--run-id run-xxxxxxxxxxxx]
    python .claude/runtime/verify_multi_phase.py --no-replay      # skip the live re-run
    python .claude/runtime/verify_multi_phase.py --json-out F

Exit code 0 only when every check passes.
