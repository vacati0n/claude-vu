"""Executable proof that the runtime recovers from classified failures.

`verify_vertical_slice.py` proves a phase can execute. `verify_multi_phase.py` proves a run is
a state machine. Neither proves anything about the paths a run takes when something goes wrong,
because a successful run never takes them. This script induces the failures instead.

Four runs, each injecting one fault, driven through the real command line rather than by
calling functions -- what is proved is the runtime an operator uses:

  Run A  a rejected artifact, repaired
         attempt 1 returns a structurally invalid plan. The Validation Engine rejects it, the
         Recovery Controller classifies `output-schema-failure` as retryable, and the work item
         moves to `retrying` with a deadline. Once the backoff elapses the scheduler promotes
         it, the re-dispatch carries the rejection back to the agent as a repair pass, and
         attempt 2 returns a conforming plan that is accepted.

  Run B  a rejected artifact, never repaired
         every attempt returns the same invalid plan. Attempts are charged, the budget bounds
         them at three, and the fourth is refused rather than granted: the work item blocks
         with a recorded reason and an open envelope, and `release` refuses to grant an attempt
         the budget does not have.

  Run C  a policy violation
         the artifact is valid, but the agent declares a write outside its permitted set. That
         is not a transient fault, so it is classified `policy-failure` and never scheduled for
         a retry. This is the negative case: it proves the policy discriminates rather than
         retrying whatever fails.

  Run D  a gate rejection, rolled back and rebuilt
         attempt 1 is accepted and its gate is rejected by a listed non-producing owner. The
         rejection is classified `gate-rejection` with action rollback; its envelope names the
         `rollback` command, which this run executes verbatim. The phase is superseded --
         re-entered as attempt 2 under its existing idempotency key, attempt 1's artifact
         untouched at its committed path -- and the gate re-armed on the same work item with
         the rejection in its `decision_history`. The stale successor block clears, the
         re-dispatch carries the rejection as `prior_rejection`, attempt 2 commits at an
         attempt-scoped path, the gate blocks again for a fresh human decision, and the
         negatives -- producer role, unlisted role, approved sibling gate on the closed
         phase, invalid target, exhausted
         budget -- are each refused without touching the store.

The harness stands in for the agent adapter and nothing else. It writes the artifact and the
result envelope the adapter would have written, then hands control back to the runtime. Every
transition, classification, and envelope this script asserts on is produced by the runtime.

Each run is keyed by its own input file, so its `run_id` is derived, not assigned. A previous
execution's run directory is removed before it is re-planned, and only ever the directories
these four inputs derive.

    python .claude/runtime/verify_recovery.py            # run all four
    python .claude/runtime/verify_recovery.py --keep     # leave the run directories in place
