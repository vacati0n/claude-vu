"""Validation Engine: requirement-framing.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `requirement-framing.md` against the contract set that governs
it:

  - `.claude/templates/requirement-framing.md`            rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/agents/omn-business-analyst/output.md`       structural and semantic output contract
  - `.claude/agents/omn-business-analyst/quality.md`      the checks the agent runs on itself

Scope boundary: `RF1` to `RF11` are the rules in that contract decidable by inspecting the
artifact. Whether the recorded requirements are the *right* requirements for the business is a
judgement the Framing Gate makes, not a property of the file. What is decidable is that the
framing is stated rather than implied: every requirement traces to a declared outcome and
carries a type, every requirement is bounded by acceptance intent that could demonstrate it,
every assumption states the basis it rests on, an incomplete framing names what is missing,
and the artifact stays inside analysis authority by carrying no task, change, or design
identifier.
