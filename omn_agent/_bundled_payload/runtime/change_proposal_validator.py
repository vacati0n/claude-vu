"""Validation Engine: framework-change-proposal.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `framework-change-proposal.md` against the contract set that
governs it:

  - `.claude/templates/framework-change-proposal.md`  rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/config/self-hosting-profile.md`          routing, Evidence Rule, Completion Rule
  - `.claude/validation/framework-release-checklist.md`  the mandatory items a framework
                                                          update must record
  - the run the proposal names, as the runtime wrote it

Scope boundary. The structural rules are the engine's (`artifact_contract.py`). What this module
adds is the only thing that makes a change proposal worth requiring: it refuses to take the
author's word for the run. `F2` to `F5` re-read `execution-request.json` and `state.json` and
compare them to what the proposal claims, so a proposal describing a run that was reached by
another command, that never executed, or whose blocked phases were quietly dropped from the table
is rejected. Whether the change is a good idea is a Design Gate judgment and is not decidable
here; whether it was actually carried by the framework is.
