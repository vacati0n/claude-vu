"""Validation Engine: validation-report.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `validation-report.md` against the contract set that governs it:

  - `.claude/templates/validation-report.md`   rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/agents/omn-qa/identity.md`        behavioural contract for the validation lens
  - `.claude/agents/omn-qa/output.md`          structural contract this artifact renders to
  - `.claude/agents/omn-qa/quality.md`         QA's own self-verification checks

One artifact type carries every validation output the framework asks for: the `fix-bug`
regression evidence, both `refactor` validations, the `review-pull-request` test adequacy
verdict, and the `release` candidate verdict. `templates/validation-report.md` records why they
are one type: each is a criterion-by-criterion result set over a defined validation scope,
closing with a readiness verdict. The `validationBasis` field carries the lens; the structure
does not change with it.

Scope boundary: `Q1` to `Q7` are QA's own decision rules and constraints, expressed as checks
over the artifact. Whether the chosen test depth was the right depth for the risk is QA's
judgement and is recorded as a not-machine-checkable obligation. Whether a pass verdict
contradicts the results and defects it sits on top of is not judgement, and is enforced.
