# Completion Package: run-437e2f765e4b

## Gate Decisions

| Gate | Closes | Required owners | Decision | Owner role | Recorded by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Framing Gate | `problem-framing` | omn-business-analyst, omn-product-owner | approved | omn-product-owner | operator on behalf of omn-product-owner |
| Technical Gate | `technical-discovery` | omn-context-agent, omn-architect | approved | omn-architect | operator on behalf of omn-architect |
| Recommendation Gate | `recommendation` | omn-tech-lead, omn-orchestrator | approved | omn-orchestrator | operator on behalf of omn-orchestrator |

Gate approval is a human decision by default. The runtime records it, enforces the Producer Exclusion Rule of `workflows/workflow-gate-matrix.md`, and refuses to invent one; an undecided gate holds its successor phase in `blocked`. Under `config/gate-policy.json`'s `auto-on-clean-evidence` mode the runtime itself may record an approval (attributed `runtime:auto-policy`, with the evaluated evidence in the decision record) when every policy condition holds; any gate the policy holds keeps the human path.

## Superseded Attempts

None: no completed phase has been re-entered under a rollback.

## Module Provenance

Modules loaded by each executed agent, in the order its manifest declares.

## State Transition Log

Every persisted work-item transition, in commit order. This is the run's primary evidence: the state of a work item is never asserted, it is derived from this log.

## Replay Suppression

No repeated call has been made against this run.

## Open Escalations

None.

## Residual Items

- Phases with a registered validator: ['behavioral-validation', 'candidate-validation', 'code-quality-review', 'communication-and-post-release', 'execution-planning', 'fix-implementation', 'implementation', 'merge-decision', 'option-analysis', 'option-synthesis', 'quality-review', 'readiness-assessment', 'recommendation', 'recommendation-draft', 'refactor-implementation', 'regression-validation', 'repository-quality-scan', 'safety-net-establishment', 'scope-and-acceptance', 'solution-design-and-risk-assessment', 'test-risk-validation'].
- Phases whose declared output artifact has no registered validator, and which therefore cannot be dispatched: [].
- `Retrying` and `Cancelled`, canonical task states in `config/task-queue.md`, are not implemented by this runtime.
