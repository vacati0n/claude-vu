"""Validation Engine: technical-recommendation.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `technical-recommendation.md` against the contract set that
governs it:

  - `.claude/templates/technical-recommendation.md`  rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/agents/omn-tech-lead/identity.md`       behavioural contract for the decision lens
  - `.claude/agents/omn-tech-lead/output.md`         structural contract this artifact renders to
  - `.claude/agents/omn-tech-lead/quality.md`        the tech lead's own self-verification checks

One artifact type carries every technical leadership output the framework asks for: both
`investigate` decision phases, both `research` decision phases, the `review-pull-request` merge
decision, and the `release` readiness assessment. `templates/technical-recommendation.md` records
why they are one type: each is a criteria-based comparison of named options over a stated decision
context, closing with a recommendation and a readiness position. The `decisionBasis` field carries
the lens; the structure does not change with it.

Scope boundary: `T1` to `T8` are the tech lead's own decision rules and constraints, expressed as
checks over the artifact. Whether the criteria were fixed before the options were scored, and
whether an effort figure is honest rather than optimistic, are judgement and are recorded as
not-machine-checkable obligations. Whether a recommendation names an option the artifact never
evaluated, whether a summary agrees with the tables under it, whether a `proceed` sits on top of an
open blocker, and whether the producer awarded itself the gate are not judgement, and are enforced.
