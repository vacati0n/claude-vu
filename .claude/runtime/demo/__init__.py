"""Demo mode -- autonomous end-to-end demonstration capture for a framework run.

`/implement --demo` records the run it drives and, when the run completes, compiles a
distribution-ready presentation from the recording with no further command. The
presentation is an edit of the real application on screen; the drawn dashboard is what it
falls back to when nothing was filmed.

    context.py        DemoContext: the per-run switch and its persisted configuration
    recorder.py       the Recorder: turns canonical runtime events, on-disk envelopes, and
                      host tool hooks into millisecond-stamped JSON execution markers
    timeline.py       marker stream -> presentation scenes (time compression, titles,
                      narration text, the "Agent Thinking..." state per scene)
    narration.py      text-to-speech over the scenes' narration, engine chain with fallbacks

    -- filming the real application (the primary path) --
    obs_ws.py         minimal obs-websocket v5 client, standard library only
    capture.py        screen capture of the Claude Desktop window (OBS, else ffmpeg), and
                      the capture manifest that maps wall clock to video time
    capture_helper.py the detached process that owns a recording while the run proceeds
    overlays.py       the presentation frame drawn around the footage: brand bar, workflow
                      rail, lower thirds, opening and closing cards
    editor.py         capture + markers -> an edit decision list -> presentation_demo.mp4

    -- drawing the run instead, when nothing was filmed --
    renderer.py       the headless dashboard: one DashboardState rendered as text (for the
                      marker's visual_snapshot_text) and as PNG frames (Pillow, optional)
    video_builder.py  frames + narration -> presentation_demo.mp4 (ffmpeg), else an
                      animated GIF, always an HTML deck; writes build-manifest.json
    deck.py           the self-contained HTML presentation deck

Zero-bloat contract
-------------------
`framework_runtime.py` touches this package at exactly three points, and every one of them
is guarded by a single `Path.exists()` on `runs/<run>/demo/demo-context.json`:

    plan --demo          -> `enable(run_dir, ...)`
    RunLedger.emit(...)  -> `on_event(run_dir, event)` after the canonical event is appended
    demo subcommand      -> `status / build / backfill / hook`

When `--demo` was never given the file does not exist, nothing here is imported, and the
main execution path pays one `stat()` per event. Nothing in this package writes outside
`runs/<run>/demo/` (plus the `runs/.active-demo` pointer the host hook reads) and nothing
here may raise into the runtime: every entry point below catches and logs to
`runs/<run>/demo/recorder.log`, because a demo that breaks the run it records is worse
than no demo.
