"""Timeline -- marker stream to presentation scenes.

A run takes minutes to hours, most of it waiting on humans at gates; a presentation takes
about ninety seconds. The timeline compresses the marker stream into scenes, each holding
the projection as it stood after the scene's last marker, a title and subtitle for the
overlay, whether the "Agent Thinking..." bar is lit, a narration sentence, and a visual
duration. Durations are proportional to what the scene shows rather than to how long it
took: an agent's four-second think is a four-second scene whether the agent took forty
seconds or forty minutes.

Markers that are bookkeeping rather than story are folded into their neighbours: the burst
of routing events joins the opening card, a frozen context slice joins the dispatch it
precedes, a gate arming or an aggregation joins the scene before it. What remains is one
scene per thing an audience would want said aloud.

Nothing here reads a clock or a file. `build_scenes(markers, options)` is a pure function of
its inputs, so the same recording always cuts to the same film.
