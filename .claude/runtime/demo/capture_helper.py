"""The detached process that owns one screen recording.

A recording has to outlive the command that starts it: the run being filmed happens in the
window afterwards, driven by whoever is driving it, and only then is the recording stopped.
So `capture.start_detached` spawns this helper, which holds the ffmpeg process or the OBS
connection, reports itself through the capture manifest, and waits for a `stop.request` file
to appear beside it.

Run directly only for debugging:

    python -m demo.capture_helper --run-dir <framework-dir>/runs/<run-id>

where `<framework-dir>` is this framework directory's real name: `.omn-agent` in a
repository the installer wrote to, `.claude` in the framework's own checkout.
