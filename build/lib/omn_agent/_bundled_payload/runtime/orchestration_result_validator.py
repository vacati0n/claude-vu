"""Validation Engine: orchestration-result.md conformance.

Mechanically checks a produced `orchestration-result.md` against the contract set that governs
it:

  - `.claude/templates/orchestration-result.md`          rendered form, section and field labels
  - `.claude/agents/omn-orchestrator/identity.md`        behavioural contract for coordination
  - `.claude/agents/omn-orchestrator/output.md`          structural contract this artifact renders to
  - `.claude/agents/omn-orchestrator/quality.md`         the orchestrator's own self-verification checks

One artifact type carries every coordination output the framework asks for: the `fix-bug` closure
record, the `refactor` closure and debt record, and the `release` deployment record.
`templates/orchestration-result.md` records why they are one type: each is a phase-by-phase
progression account over a defined coordination scope, closing with a coordination position. The
`coordinationBasis` field carries the lens; the structure does not change with it.

Scope boundary: `O1` to `O9` are the orchestrator's own decision rules and constraints, expressed
as checks over the artifact. Whether the sequence chosen was the right sequence for the risk is
coordination judgement and is recorded as a not-machine-checkable obligation. Whether a record
claims a progression its own gate ledger contradicts is not judgement, and is enforced.

The check that matters most here is `O4`. Every other role's validator guards against overstating
its own evidence; a coordinator's characteristic failure is different, and worse: awarding itself
the gate decision that its own output is the evidence for. The Producer Exclusion Rule in
`workflows/workflow-gate-matrix.md` exists to stop exactly that, and `O4` is that rule expressed
as an artifact check rather than as an expectation.
