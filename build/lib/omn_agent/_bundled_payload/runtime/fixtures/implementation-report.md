## Implementation Summary

- Change intent: a reclaimed work item clears its lease fields inside the same transition that returns it to a dispatchable status.
- Approach taken: the lease fields were moved under the ownership of the status transition, so no code path can set a status without settling the lease that belongs to it.
- Design reference: the lease-ownership element of the accepted design, and the decision record that made the transition the single writer of both.
- Out of scope: the visibility-timeout and lease-expiry behaviour, which the design defers to a later increment and which no change here touches.

## Change Set

| ID | Path | Change Type | Purpose | Design Ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `C-001` | `state_engine.py` | modified | Clear lease fields transactionally with the status change | design element for lease ownership |
| `C-002` | `state_engine.py` | added | Refuse a dispatchable status that still carries a populated lease | decision record on the single-writer rule |
| `C-003` | `tests/test_state_engine.py` | added | Cover the reclaim-then-dispatch sequence end to end | verification plan of the accepted design |

## Test Evidence

| ID | Test | Type | Covers | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T-001` | reclaim clears the lease fields | unit | `C-001` | `pytest tests/test_state_engine.py -k reclaim_clears_lease` | pass |
| `T-002` | a dispatchable status carrying a lease is refused | unit | `C-002` | `pytest tests/test_state_engine.py -k refuses_stale_lease` | pass |
| `T-003` | reclaim then dispatch issues exactly one envelope | regression | `C-001`, `C-002`, `C-003` | `pytest tests/test_state_engine.py -k reclaim_then_dispatch` | pass |

## Verification Results

- Verification method: the three tests above were executed against the changed module, together with the existing state-engine suite as a regression baseline.
- Commands executed: `pytest tests/test_state_engine.py`
- Result summary: 27 tests executed, 27 passed, 0 failed, including the 3 added by this change.
- Unverified areas: none

## Deviations and Tradeoffs

| ID | Deviation | Design element | Rationale | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `V-001` | The refusal in `C-002` raises rather than returning a status object | error surface of the transition API | Every other invariant breach in this module raises, and a second convention would make the caller decide which one applies | not-required |

## Boundary Compliance

- Module boundaries preserved: the change stays inside the state engine; no caller was altered and no new dependency was introduced.
- Public interface changes: none; no exported signature, schema, or contract changed.
- Data or migration impact: none; the persisted work-item shape is unchanged and existing run state loads without conversion.
- Declared side effects: the two files named in the change set, plus this report and the result envelope.

## Residual Risk

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `R-001` | A caller that reads lease fields directly rather than through the transition still sees a stale value | low | medium | The refusal added by `C-002` turns such a read into a failure at the next dispatch rather than a silent duplicate |

## Handoff Notes

- Reviewer focus areas: the transition boundary in `C-001`, where the status write and the lease clear must remain in one commit.
- Follow-up work: the deferred visibility-timeout behaviour, which the design names as the next increment.
- Documentation impact: the lease description in the runtime notes now understates the invariant and should be updated by the documentation phase.
