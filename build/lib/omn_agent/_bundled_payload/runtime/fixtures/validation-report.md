## Metadata

- Validation ID: VAL-2026-0071
- Validator: omn-qa
- Change under validation: bounded retry delay and the classification record passed to the scheduler
- Validation date: 2026-08-19

## Validation Scope

- In scope: the retry delay computation, the classification-to-action mapping, and every existing recovery path the change touches.
- Out of scope: the artifact validators, which the change does not reach and which carry their own coverage proof.
- Evidence examined: the recovery proof output, the transition log of two induced-failure runs, the retry ledger of the exhausted-budget run, and the full defect reproduction transcript.

## Test Strategy

- Risk basis: the change alters a path that decides whether work resumes or stops, so a defect here silently strands a run rather than failing loudly; that warranted exhaustive branch coverage rather than a sampled regression pass.
- Levels executed: unit over the delay computation, integration over the classification-to-action mapping, and end-to-end over two induced-failure runs.
- Environment: the repository's own runtime under the committed fixture set, which matches target except that no real external dependency is reachable.
- Not executed: performance, because the change removes work from the hot path rather than adding it, and security, because no input surface, credential path, or external call is introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria Results

| ID | Criterion | Source | Method | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AC-001` | A computed retry delay never exceeds the profile maximum | `bug-analysis.md` defect statement | unit, over the full attempt range including the raised ceiling | met | delay computation exercised to attempt 12; maximum observed equals the profile cap |
| `AC-002` | A non-retryable class is never scheduled for retry | `bug-analysis.md` regression target | integration, over every declared failure class | met | classification-to-action mapping asserted for all 9 classes; no retry scheduled for the 4 non-retryable ones |
| `AC-003` | An exhausted retry budget reaches the terminal branch | `bug-analysis.md` regression target | end-to-end, induced-failure run to budget exhaustion | met | retry ledger shows the terminal branch entered once, with the exhaustion reason recorded |
| `AC-004` | The classification record reaches every call site unchanged | `implementation-report.md` change account | integration, across the three call sites the change consolidated | met | the same record identity observed at all three sites in the transition log |
| `AC-005` | Recovery behaviour is unchanged for the aggregation-conflict class | `bug-analysis.md` regression target | integration, attempted over the aggregation-conflict path | blocked | no current path can raise this class, so the branch is unreachable from any executable entry point |

## Execution Summary

- Criteria validated: 5
- Met: 4
- Not met: 0
- Blocked: 1

## Defects

| ID | Severity | Category | Location | Symptom | Reproducibility | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DF-001` | medium | operational | retry scheduling entry path | a scheduled retry advances only when a command is next invoked, so an unattended run waits indefinitely rather than resuming at its due time | always | open |
| `DF-002` | low | regression | recovery ledger reason field | the recorded reason for an exhausted budget reads as the generic terminal reason rather than the exhaustion-specific one | always | resolved |

## Regression Assessment

- Regression scope: every recovery path that reads a classification result, the retry scheduler, and the terminal branch each of them can reach.
- Regressions detected: None identified.
- Coverage of changed behavior: every classification branch the change touches is reached by an executed check except the aggregation-conflict branch, which no executable path can raise today.
- Untested areas: the aggregation-conflict branch, recorded above as `AC-005` and carried forward as an open question rather than reported as covered.

## Residual Risk

- Accepted risk: the aggregation-conflict branch stays unexercised until a path exists that can raise it; the branch is unreachable, so the risk is latent rather than present.
- Unmitigated risk: `DF-001` leaves an unattended run dependent on a later invocation to progress, which is a change in timing rather than in outcome.
- Monitoring required: the recovery ledger, for a scheduled retry whose due time has passed without an invocation to advance it.

## Verdict

- Decision: pass-with-reservations
- Rationale: every criterion reachable by an executable path is met on recorded evidence, no regression was detected across the declared regression scope, and the single blocked criterion is blocked by unreachability rather than by a failure.
- Blocking defects outstanding: None identified.
- Readiness recommendation: proceed to the Verification Gate; `DF-001` is worth a follow-up work item but does not warrant holding this change.

## Open Questions

- `Q-001`: what path is intended to raise the aggregation-conflict class, so that `AC-005` becomes validatable rather than permanently blocked?
