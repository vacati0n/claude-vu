## Metadata

- Review ID: RVW-2026-0058
- Reviewer: omn-dev-2-reviewer
- Change under review: classified retry policy and structured failure envelopes
- Review date: 2026-08-18

## Review Scope

- In scope: the recovery classification path, the retry scheduling path, and the envelope written on every blocked transition.
- Out of scope: the artifact validators, reviewed separately under their own package.
- Evidence reviewed: the full diff of the recovery path, the transition log of one induced-failure run, and the recovery proof output.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Category | Location | Requirement | Finding | Correction Request | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `F-001` | high | correctness | `runtime/recovery_policy.py` backoff computation | `config/runtime.md` retry policy requires bounded delay | the computed delay is not capped, so a raised attempt ceiling would produce an unbounded wait | `CR-001` | open |
| `F-002` | medium | maintainability | `runtime/framework_runtime.py` classification call sites | `memory/coding-standard.md` single-responsibility rule | the classification result is unpacked at three call sites rather than passed as one record | `CR-002` | open |
| `F-003` | low | standards | `runtime/recovery_policy.py` module docstring | `domain-model/agent-specification.md` traceability rule | the docstring names the policy source but not the specific section | | resolved |

## Severity Summary

- Critical: 0
- High: 1
- Medium: 1
- Low: 1

## Standards and Architecture Conformance

- Coding standards: conformant; naming, module boundaries, and docstring conventions match the surrounding runtime.
- Architecture rules: conformant; classification stays out of the state engine, which continues to know nothing about failure classes.
- Security criteria: no new input surface, no credential handling, and no external call introduced.
- Exceptions requested: None identified.

## Test Adequacy Assessment

- Test evidence reviewed: the induced-failure run, its transition log, and the negative checks that assert a non-retryable class is never scheduled for retry.
- Coverage of changed behavior: every classification branch is exercised except the aggregation-conflict class, which no current path can raise.
- Gaps requiring new tests: a case that exhausts the retry budget on a produced-nothing failure, which reaches the terminal branch by a different route than the rejected-artifact case.

## Correction Requests

| ID | Addresses | Required change | Blocking | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CR-001` | `F-001` | cap the computed delay at the profile maximum and assert the cap in the recovery proof | yes | omn-dev-1-implement |
| `CR-002` | `F-002` | return the classification as one record and unpack it once | no | omn-dev-1-implement |

## Residual Risk

- Accepted risk: the aggregation-conflict class stays unexercised until a path can raise it.
- Unmitigated risk: retry scheduling advances only when a command is invoked, so an unattended run does not progress.
- Monitoring required: the recovery ledger, for a classification whose chosen action does not match its declared class.

## Verdict

- Decision: approve-with-corrections
- Rationale: the classification path is correct and well bounded in every case the change can reach today, and the one high finding is a latent bound rather than a present defect.
- Blocking findings outstanding: `F-001`
- Readiness recommendation: merge once `CR-001` lands; `CR-002` may follow separately.
