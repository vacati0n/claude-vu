## Metadata

- Orchestration ID: ORC-2026-0042
- Coordinator: omn-orchestrator
- Run under coordination: the release of the bounded retry-delay change and its recovery ledger correction
- Coordination date: 2026-08-19

## Coordination Scope

- In scope: the five phases this release enqueued, the four artifact handoffs between them, and the four gates the gate matrix declares for this workflow.
- Out of scope: the merge that produced the candidate, which closed under its own run and is cited here rather than re-accounted.
- Evidence examined: the readiness recommendation, the packaging evidence, the candidate validation report, the recorded decision at each of the four gates, and the deployment and rollback plans the execution ran against.

## Phase Progression

| ID | Phase | Owner | Declared Output | Gate | Gate Decision | Decided By | Evidence | Progression |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PH-001` | `readiness-assessment` | `omn-tech-lead` | `technical-recommendation.md` | Readiness Gate | approved | `omn-qa` | recorded decision at the Readiness Gate, citing the candidate validation verdict | complete |
| `PH-002` | `artifact-packaging` | `omn-dev-2-reviewer` | versioned artifacts with packaging evidence | Artifact Gate | approved | `omn-tech-lead` | recorded decision at the Artifact Gate, citing the version manifest and the build provenance record | complete |
| `PH-003` | `candidate-validation` | `omn-qa` | `validation-report.md` | none | not-applicable | not-applicable | validation report accepted by the runtime at its declared artifact path | complete |
| `PH-004` | `deployment-execution` | `omn-orchestrator` | `orchestration-result.md` | Deployment Gate | approved | `omn-tech-lead` | recorded decision at the Deployment Gate, citing this record and the monitoring window it reports | complete |
| `PH-005` | `communication-and-post-release` | `omn-documentation` | `release-note.md` | Communication Gate | none | not-applicable | not started; this phase reads the operational status this record carries and is enqueued behind it | not-started |

## Progression Summary

## Handoffs

| ID | From | To | Artifact | Accepted | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HO-001` | `omn-tech-lead` | `omn-dev-2-reviewer` | `technical-recommendation.md` | accepted | input contract satisfied at the packaging phase; the recommendation resolved as the declared input |
| `HO-002` | `omn-dev-2-reviewer` | `omn-qa` | versioned artifacts with packaging evidence | accepted | the packaging evidence resolved as the candidate-validation input, and the version under test matches the manifest |
| `HO-003` | `omn-qa` | `omn-orchestrator` | `validation-report.md` | accepted | the validation report resolved at its declared path with a pass-with-reservations verdict and no open critical or high defect |
| `HO-004` | `omn-orchestrator` | `omn-documentation` | `orchestration-result.md` | pending | this record is the declared input to the communication phase, which has not been leased yet |

## Escalations

| ID | Severity | Category | Raised By | Routed To | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ES-001` | medium | operational | `omn-orchestrator` | `omn-tech-lead` | resolved | the monitoring window the deployment plan declared was shorter than the interval at which the recovery ledger reports, so health could not be read at the declared checkpoint; the window was extended and the checkpoint moved |
| `ES-002` | low | coordination | `omn-orchestrator` | `omn-documentation` | routed | the post-release action plan the communication phase owns has no owner assigned for the follow-up monitoring item recorded below |

## Follow-Up Actions

| ID | Category | Description | Owner | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FU-001` | monitoring | watch the recovery ledger for a scheduled retry whose due time passes without an invocation to advance it, which the validation recorded as an open defect of timing rather than of outcome | `omn-qa` | medium | open |
| `FU-002` | documentation | the release note must carry the extended monitoring window as the operational note, rather than the window the deployment plan originally declared | `omn-documentation` | low | scheduled |

## Operational Status

- Deployment state: deployed
- Environment: the repository's own runtime under the committed fixture set, which matches target except that no real external dependency is reachable.
- Monitoring health: the recovery ledger reported no stranded work item across the extended window, the transition log recorded no unexpected terminal branch, and the retry ledger showed delays bounded by the profile cap at every observed attempt.
- Rollback position: armed and unexercised; the rollback plan's single step is a revert of the delay profile, which the run verified as reachable before deployment and did not need.

## Coordination Position

- Decision: closed-with-followups
- Rationale: every gated phase this release enqueued carries a recorded decision taken by the authority the gate matrix assigns it, the deployment reached the declared state with monitoring reporting healthy across the extended window, and the two items left open are a monitoring watch and a documentation note rather than work this release was obliged to finish.
- Blocking escalations outstanding: None identified.
- Closure recommendation: proceed to `communication-and-post-release`; the Deployment Gate decision rests with `omn-tech-lead`, which this record is evidence for rather than a substitute for.

## Open Questions

- `Q-001`: should the monitoring window be a declared field of the deployment plan rather than a convention, so that a checkpoint shorter than the reporting interval is caught before execution rather than escalated during it?
