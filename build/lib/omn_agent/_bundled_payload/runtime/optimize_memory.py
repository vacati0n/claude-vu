"""Token optimizer for the framework's durable knowledge surfaces.

Memory, context, and instruction files are read into every run's context slice, so their token
cost is paid on every dispatch rather than once. This module rewrites them denser without
rewriting what they say.

The honest claim, stated up front, is the one this module is built around: a language model
cannot *prove* it preserved meaning, and no prompt makes it able to. So nothing here trusts the
model's own assurance. Compression is proposed by the model and then judged mechanically against
invariants extracted from the original — headings, fenced code, frontmatter, link targets, table
shape, inline identifiers, declared rule identifiers. A candidate that drops one is rejected and
the original file is left exactly as it was. "Lossless" in this module means *these invariants
held*, which is a checkable claim, and the report says which ones were checked.

Three consequences follow, and they are the module's operating rules:

- **The default is a dry run.** `run` proposes and reports; `--apply` is what overwrites.
- **Nothing is overwritten un-backed-up.** Every applied pass writes the pre-image, digests, and
  a manifest under `runs/optimize-memory/<stamp>/`, and `restore` puts them back.
- **Generated surfaces are never touched.** Run evidence, reports, proposals, changelogs, and
  anything the framework writes for itself are denied by path, not by convention -- a rewritten
  record of what happened would corrupt the evidence the governance layer resolves against.

    python .claude/runtime/optimize_memory.py scan
    python .claude/runtime/optimize_memory.py run
    python .claude/runtime/optimize_memory.py run --apply
    python .claude/runtime/optimize_memory.py restore --manifest runs/optimize-memory/<stamp>/manifest.json

Requires the `anthropic` package and resolvable API credentials for `run`; `scan` and `restore`
are offline and need neither.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You compress technical Markdown to its minimum token cost without changing what it means.

The document you receive is a durable instruction, memory, or context file read by automated \
agents on every task. Every token in it is paid repeatedly. Your single job is to make it \
cheaper to read while leaving every instruction, constraint, identifier, and decision it \
carries exactly as binding as before.

REMOVE:
- Filler, throat-clearing, and restatements of what an adjacent sentence already said.
- Motivational or self-congratulatory prose that carries no rule.
- Redundant transitions, hedges, and meta-commentary about the document itself.
- Repeated qualifiers where one statement of the qualifier governs the section.

REWRITE:
- Long sentences into punchy declarative fragments.
- Passive constructions into active ones.
- Multi-sentence explanations into one sentence, or a list row, when nothing is lost.
- Prose enumerations into terse lists.

NEVER CHANGE, DROP, OR REORDER:
- YAML frontmatter. Reproduce the block between the leading `---` fences byte for byte.
- Any fenced code block. Reproduce every fence and its contents byte for byte.
- Any heading. Same text, same level, same order. Add none, remove none, merge none.
- Any table. Same header cells, same number of body rows, same row order.
- Any identifier: rule and requirement codes (SR-1, C-3, E-7, FR-05, S10, Q1.1, T-004, \
GD-001), file paths, command lines, flags, URLs, link targets, inline `code` spans, \
acronyms, proper nouns, version numbers, dates, and numeric thresholds.
- Any negation, obligation, permission, or exception. "must", "must not", "never", "only", \
"unless", "except", and their scope survive verbatim in force even when reworded.
- Any conditional. If a rule fires under a condition, the condition survives.
- Any list item. Compress an item's wording; do not merge two items into one or drop one.

If a passage is already minimal, return it unchanged. Losing a rule to save tokens is a \
total failure of the task; returning a document that is merely 5% smaller but complete is a \
success.

Output the rewritten Markdown document and nothing else. No preamble, no explanation, no \
summary of changes, and no code fence wrapped around the whole document.\
