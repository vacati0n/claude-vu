"""Manifest and agent-contract shape verification.

Answers two questions no other verify_*.py script covers, using the same resolvers the
runtime itself uses so this report cannot agree with a runtime that would disagree:

  M1  Is every declared `authorityScope.repositoryWrites.scope`/`excluded`, on a manifest
      that declares `allowed: true`, a YAML list of glob patterns rather than a prose string?
      A string there is silently exploded character-by-character by Python's `list(...)` at
      dispatch time (see `framework_runtime._glob_list`), corrupting every dispatch envelope's
      `permitted_writes` for that agent without raising anywhere.

  M2  Does every contract clause a real run traced a first-attempt validation failure to
      still carry its pointer to a concrete worked example? See `REQUIRED_EXAMPLE_POINTERS`
      below -- this is deliberately scoped to the specific clauses ON-165 exercised, not a
      blanket rule over every agent's docs, since which clauses need a worked example is a
      judgment call this script cannot make on its own.

Usage:
    python .claude/runtime/verify_manifests.py
    python .claude/runtime/verify_manifests.py --json-out manifests.json

Exit code 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
